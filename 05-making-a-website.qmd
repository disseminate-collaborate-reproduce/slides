## How to Create a Quarto Website Document

- Create a **'New Project'** in RStudio
- Select **'New Directory'**
- Select **'Quarto Website'**
- Let's see what we have in our panes
  - Source Editor (see some files are already opened)
  - Build pane (allows us to render the website) (please DO NOT RENDER yet!)
  - Files pane (we have .yml file, .css file, and several .qmd files)

:::


## Introducing the basics

- index file
  - It will be the home page of our website.
- .yml file 
  - Every website has a `.yml` config file that provides website options as well as defaults for HTML documents created within the site.
  - Let's create an output directory for our webpage as `output-dir: docs`
- Find **'Build'** pane on the right and click **'Render Website'**
  - Let's explore `.yml` file again to understand the basics of website navigation



## Let's Get it Published!

- We will use GitHub pages deployment but there are other options as well (e.g., Netlify, Posit Connect)
- Sign in to YOUR GitHub account
- Create a new **public** repo called **username.github.io**
- Click **Settings** on the top
- Click **Pages** on the left
- Where it says `none`, select `main`
- Where it says `/(root)`, select `/docs` and click `Save`
- You are almost ready.
