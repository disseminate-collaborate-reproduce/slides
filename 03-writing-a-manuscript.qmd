## In this section...

. . .

We will cover the basics of writing a manuscript (technically, not conceptually) by using a journal format in Quarto. 

. . .

To learn more about Quarto Journal Formats see <https://quarto.org/docs/journals/>.

. . .

Alternatively, you can use The `rticles` package which provides a suite of custom R Markdown LaTeX formats and templates for various formats.  <https://github.com/rstudio/rticles>

## Creating A New Article Template
. . .

- We will use the template of **Journals of the American Statistical Association (JASA)**
- You each have a repo with the name `03-manuscript-username` on GitHub.com. 
- Please find and clone this repo and we will go through this repo together.

. . . 

## Let's Grasp the Basics - I

- Get familiar with some files
  - **`README.md` file:** the first file that a user will visit in your repo (Mine will talk about it later).
  - **`.pdf` file:** preview of your rendered template
  - **`bibliography.bib` file:** BibLaTeX file, a bibliographic data source


## Let's Grasp the Basics - II

- Open the `03-manuscript-username.qmd` file
- Click **Render** and compare `.qmd` file and `.pdf` file together 
  - blinding the manuscript
  - cross referencing a table
  - citation (how to copy them to `.bib` file)
  - equations and numbering equations
  - cross referencing a figure

## Alternatively...

You can use a template by using a command 

```{.r}
quarto use template quarto-journals/jasa
```
